# Our story is about one Christmas Eve, all of the lights go out at the North Pole. Santa soon discovers that all of the reindeer have been infected with a disease that makes them
# hyper-aggressive and have an unsatiable bloodlust. Santa must travel to many different locations in the North Pole to gather all of the ingredients for the antidote.
